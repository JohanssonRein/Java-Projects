# Java-Project-2
In this project, I mainly used linked list to create a structure of a game, I used a singly linked list to represent caterpillar, and it will move on the board and eat different food and perform different operations. This included operations on linked list, like adding / deleting / shifting the elements in the list as well as the positions for each element. Object oriented programming is also used in this project.
